## Bridging Climate Science and Public Health

This platform showcases research at the intersection of **seasonal-to-subseasonal (S2S) forecasting**, **hydrological modeling**, and **disease ecology**.

### Current Research Themes

**Amazon Ecosystem Dynamics**  
Investigating how climate variability and land-use changes impact malaria transmission in Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil. Recent work published in *PLOS Climate* demonstrates critical linkages between deforestation, hydrology, and vector-borne disease.

**Transboundary Water Management**  
Analyzing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's filling process and downstream impacts using Sentinel and satellite altimetry data. Featured in NASA Earth Observatory.

**High Mountain Asia Hydrology**  
Developing improved ground temperature and permafrost extent estimates by integrating MODIS LST with AIRS retrievals.

### Tools & Methods

- Multi-satellite data fusion (optical, thermal, microwave)
- Process-based hydrological models
- Machine learning for climate-health prediction
- Interactive geospatial visualization
